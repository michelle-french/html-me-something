                    <h2>Sugar</h2>
                    <p>Sugar is an ornate box turtle. She is small but mighty. Her favorite food is organic apples. A couple of years ago, we met. Sugar was a rescue, injured in a weed-eater accident. She quickly learned her way around the yard. Sugar is fast and sly, she speeds across half an acre of hilly landscape in mere minutes.</p>

                    <h2>Chong</h2>
                    <p>Chong is an old friend of mine. He is a red eared slider. He loves live worms to eat. Chong is a water turtle, but also likes rock climbing and chilling in the sun. He was a rescue from a dirty situation way back in 2009. He seems jolly and humble, that's probably why he is so easy to get along with. </p>

                    <h2>Scarlet</h2>
                    <p>Scarlet is a red footed tortoise. She loves all fruit &#38; veggies, also dandelion &#38; clover flowers. She thinks I don't know that she steals dog food. She is actually the sister of Vince, they came from the same family that could no longer care for them. Scarlet is the sweetest dinosaur I have ever known.</p>

                    <h2>Vince</h2>
                    <p>Vince is my scariest friend. He is a Honduran curly hair tarantula, who likes to eat live insects. We have been friends for almost 4 years now. I did not choose him as my pet, but I felt the need to save him. I am still scared, but he is growing on me. We do have a thing in common, Vince and I both like relaxing in the sun.</p>

                    <h2>Fluffy</h2>
                    <p>Oh Fluffy! She is a gray domestic longhair kitty. She prefers grain-free cat food and, if I am not careful, rubberbands. I watched her be born into the world &#62;13 years ago. Her mom was my first pet ever, I guess that makes me Fluffy's grandma! She is silly and sweet. Fluffy follows me around and wags her tail like a puppy. </p>

                    <h2>Delilah</h2>
                    <p>Delilah is a treeing walker coonhound. She likes grain-free dog food and whatever her human sister sneaks to her from the kitchen table. She was a rescue from the Portland Humane Society in 2009, she is almost 12 years old. Delilah is a highly sensitive tree-climbing watchdog. She is all bark and only gentle nibbles. She loves being part of our pack. Delilah's favorite things are singing, sniffing around and waiting for delivery trucks to bark at.</p>
